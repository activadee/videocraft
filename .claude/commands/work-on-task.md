## Enhanced Error Handling & Validation

### Planning Phase Validation
```bash
# Validate multi-LLM planning completion
if [[ ! -f "plan.md" ]]; then
  echo "‚ùå Error: plan.md not found - Planning phase incomplete"
  echo "Required: Complete UltraThink analysis and Gemini collaboration"
  exit 1
fi

# Validate plan quality
plan_sections=(
  "UltraThink Analysis"
  "Three Solution Approaches" 
  "Gemini Collaboration"
  "Selected Approach"
  "Implementation Phases"
  "Test Strategy"
)

for section in "${plan_sections[@]}"; do
  if ! grep -q "$section" plan.md; then
    echo "‚ùå Error: Missing plan section: $section"
    exit 1
  fi
done

echo "‚úÖ Plan validation complete - Multi-LLM planning adequate"
```

### Implementation Validation
```bash
# Validate plan adherence during implementation
validate_plan_adherence() {
  echo "üîç Validating implementation against plan.md..."
  
  # Check planned files exist
  planned_files=$(grep -o 'src/[^[:space:]]*\.js' plan.md)
  for file in $planned_files; do
    if [[ ! -f "$file" ]]; then
      echo "‚ùå Planned file missing: $file"
      return 1
    fi
  done
  
  # Check planned tests exist
  planned_tests=$(grep -o 'tests/[^[:space:]]*\.test\.js' plan.md)
  for test in $planned_tests; do
    if [[ ! -f "$test" ]]; then
      echo "‚ùå Planned test missing: $test"
      return 1
    fi
  done
  
  echo "‚úÖ Plan adherence validated"
  return 0
