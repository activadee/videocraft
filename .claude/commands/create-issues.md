   Collaborative tools:
   â€¢ mcp__multi-ai-collab__ask_all_ais - Ask all AIs the same question
   â€¢ mcp__multi-ai-collab__ai_debate - Have two AIs debate a topic
   â€¢ mcp__multi-ai-collab__server_status - Check which AIs are available

   Individual AI tools:
   â€¢ mcp__multi-ai-collab__ask_[ai_name]
   â€¢ mcp__multi-ai-collab__[ai_name]_code_review
2. **Create** a comprehensive Issue with detailed task breakdown
3. **Structure** the issue with clear sections, checklists, and acceptance criteria
4. **Apply** appropriate labels, milestones, and metadata
5. **Include** implementation roadmap and testing requirements
6. **Establish** clear definition of done and success criteria
