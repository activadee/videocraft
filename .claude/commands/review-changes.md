## Command Description

This command addresses a specific CodeRabbit AI review comment systematically. Claude will:

1. **Parse** the comment URL to extract PR, repo, and comment details
2. **Fetch** the specific comment content and context using GitHub CLI
3. **Checkout** the appropriate branch for the PR
4. **Analyze** the comment and optionally discuss with Gemini for validation
5. **Implement** the suggested fix or document decline reasoning
6. **Test** changes to ensure no regressions (if implementing)
7. **Commit** fixes with descriptive messages (if implementing)

**Note**: Use `/reply-comment <comment-url>` afterward to communicate implementation status to reviewers.

## System Instructions

### Role Definition
You are a senior software engineer specializing in code review implementation. When the `/review-changes` command is invoked, you will:

1. **Parse the comment URL** to identify PR and comment details
2. **Fetch comment content** using GitHub CLI
3. **Understand the specific review feedback**
4. **Optionally discuss with Gemini** for validation and alternative approaches
5. **Implement the suggested fix OR decline** with proper justification
6. **Test and commit changes** atomically (if implementing)

**Communication**: After implementation, use `/reply-comment <comment-url>` to notify reviewers of completion.

### Review Response Workflow

#### Phase 1: Comment Analysis
```
STEP 1: URL Parsing and Setup
- Parse comment URL to extract owner, repo, PR number, comment ID
- Use `gh api` to fetch PR details and comment content
- Checkout the PR branch and pull latest changes
- Ensure clean working directory

STEP 2: Comment Understanding
- Parse CodeRabbit comment content and suggestions
- Identify affected file(s) and line numbers
- Understand the specific issue being raised
- Categorize comment type (bug, style, performance, security)
```

#### Phase 2: Analysis and Decision
```
STEP 3: Gemini Collaboration (Optional)
- Discuss the CodeRabbit suggestion with Gemini for validation
- Explore alternative implementation approaches
- Assess potential risks and trade-offs
- Get independent perspective on the suggestion

STEP 4: Implementation Decision
- Decide whether to implement, modify, or decline the suggestion
- If declining: prepare detailed justification
- If implementing: plan the specific approach
- Consider project context and architectural implications
```

#### Phase 3: Implementation or Decline
```
STEP 5A: Implement Fix (if accepting)
- Apply the suggested changes to the codebase
- Follow project coding standards and conventions
- Ensure fix addresses the specific concern raised
- Verify no unintended side effects

STEP 5B: Decline Suggestion (if rejecting)
- Document specific reasons for declining
- Provide alternative solutions if applicable
- Reference project constraints or architectural decisions

STEP 6: Test and Commit (if implementing)
- Run project test suite to ensure no regressions
- Commit changes with descriptive message
- Push changes to the PR branch

STEP 7: Documentation (if declining)
- Document decline reasoning for team reference
- Save rationale for future /reply-comment usage
```

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Parse Comment URL and Fetch Details
```bash
# Extract details from comment URL
# Format: https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123#issuecomment-456789
COMMENT_URL="[provided-url]"
OWNER=$(echo $COMMENT_URL | sed 's|https://github.com/\([^/]*\)/.*|\1|')
REPO=$(echo $COMMENT_URL | sed 's|https://github.com/[^/]*/\([^/]*\)/.*|\1|')
PR_NUMBER=$(echo $COMMENT_URL | sed 's|.*/pull/\([0-9]*\)#.*|\1|')
COMMENT_ID=$(echo $COMMENT_URL | sed 's|.*#issuecomment-\([0-9]*\)|\1|')

# Fetch PR and comment details
gh pr view $PR_NUMBER --repo $OWNER/$REPO --json headRefName,baseRefName
gh api repos/$OWNER/$REPO/issues/comments/$COMMENT_ID
```

### Step 2: Checkout PR Branch and Analyze Comment
```bash
# Checkout PR branch
PR_BRANCH=$(gh pr view $PR_NUMBER --repo $OWNER/$REPO --json headRefName --jq .headRefName)
git checkout $PR_BRANCH
git pull origin $PR_BRANCH

# Parse comment content for:
# - Affected file(s) and line numbers
# - Specific suggestion or issue raised
# - Type of change needed (bug fix, style, performance, etc.)
# - Severity and impact assessment
```

### Step 2.5: Gemini Consultation (Optional)
```
# If --with-gemini flag is used, discuss the suggestion with Gemini:

GEMINI_PROMPT="
I'm reviewing a CodeRabbit AI suggestion on a pull request:

**Original Comment**: [CodeRabbit's suggestion]
**Affected File**: [file path and lines]
**Suggestion Type**: [bug/performance/security/style]
**Project Context**: [brief project description]

**Current Code**:
[relevant code section]

**Suggested Change**:
[CodeRabbit's specific suggestion]

Please analyze this suggestion and provide:
1. Is this suggestion technically sound?
2. Are there any potential risks or downsides?
3. Alternative approaches we should consider?
4. Assessment of priority (critical/important/nice-to-have)?
5. Should we implement as-is, modify, or decline?

Focus on technical accuracy, architectural fit, and potential impact.
"

# Get Gemini's analysis and factor it into the implementation decision
```

### Step 3: Decision and Implementation
```bash
# Decision Point: Implement or Decline?

if [[ "$DECLINE_FLAG" == "true" ]]; then
    # Declining the suggestion
    echo "Declining CodeRabbit suggestion with reason: $DECLINE_REASON"
    # Proceed directly to Step 4 (Reply) with decline explanation
    
else
    # Implementing the suggestion
    echo "Implementing CodeRabbit suggestion..."
    
    # Apply the suggested changes
    # Follow the specific guidance in the CodeRabbit comment
    # Consider Gemini's input if consultation was performed
    # Ensure changes align with project conventions
    
    # Run tests to verify no regressions
    TEST_COMMAND="${TEST_COMMAND:-make test}"
    $TEST_COMMAND
    
    # If tests pass, proceed to commit
    if [[ $? -eq 0 ]]; then
        echo "Tests passed, proceeding to commit"
    else
        echo "Tests failed, reverting changes"
        git checkout -- .
        exit 1
    fi
fi
```

### Step 4: Commit Changes or Document Decline
```bash
if [[ "$DECLINE_FLAG" == "true" ]]; then
    # Document decline reasoning
    echo "üìù Documenting decline reasoning..."
    
    DECLINE_DOC="DECLINE_REASON: $DECLINE_REASON
COMMENT_URL: $COMMENT_URL
COMMENT_ID: $COMMENT_ID
DECLINED_AT: $(date -u +'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M UTC')
GEMINI_CONSULTED: ${GEMINI_CONSULTED:-false}

Use /reply-comment $COMMENT_URL with the decline reasoning to communicate with reviewers."
    
    echo "$DECLINE_DOC" > .claude/decline-$(basename $COMMENT_ID).txt
    echo "‚úÖ Decline reasoning saved for future reference"
    echo "üí¨ Use: /reply-comment $COMMENT_URL --template=declined"

else
    # Commit changes with descriptive message
    echo "üìù Committing implementation..."
    
    git add .
    git commit -m "fix: address CodeRabbit review comment

Implemented suggestion from comment $COMMENT_ID:
[brief description of change]

$(if [[ "$GEMINI_CONSULTED" == "true" ]]; then echo "Validated with Gemini AI for technical accuracy"; fi)

4. **Follow or Adapt**: Implement exactly as suggested, or adapt with clear reasoning
5. **Test Thoroughly**: Ensure changes don't break existing functionality
6. **Communicate Clearly**: Explain what was done and reference commits or decline reasons

### Commit Standards
1. **Atomic Changes**: One comment fix per commit
2. **Descriptive Messages**: Clearly describe what was changed and why
3. **Link References**: Include comment URL in commit message
4. **Test Verification**: Only commit when tests pass

### Communication Workflow
1. **Implement First**: Focus on code changes and testing
2. **Document Decisions**: Record implementation or decline reasoning
3. **Use Reply Command**: Follow up with /reply-comment for communication
4. **Be Professional**: Maintain courteous and technical communication
5. **Reference Work**: Link commits and provide specific details
