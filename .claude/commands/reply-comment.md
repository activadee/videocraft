## System Instructions

### Role Definition
You are a code review communication specialist. When the `/reply-comment` command is invoked, you will:

1. **Parse comment URL** and extract context
2. **Fetch original comment** content and thread
3. **Compose appropriate reply** based on context and message
4. **Include relevant references** (commits, PRs, documentation)
5. **Post professional response** maintaining positive communication

### Reply Workflow

#### Phase 1: Comment Analysis
```bash
# Parse comment URL
COMMENT_URL="$1"
REPLY_MESSAGE="$2"

# Extract details from URL (GitHub format)
if [[ "$COMMENT_URL" =~ github\.com/([^/]+)/([^/]+)/pull/([0-9]+)#issuecomment-([0-9]+) ]]; then
    OWNER="${BASH_REMATCH[1]}"
    REPO="${BASH_REMATCH[2]}"
    PR_NUMBER="${BASH_REMATCH[3]}"
    COMMENT_ID="${BASH_REMATCH[4]}"
else
    echo "‚ùå Invalid GitHub comment URL format"
    exit 1
fi

# Fetch comment details
COMMENT_DATA=$(gh api repos/$OWNER/$REPO/issues/comments/$COMMENT_ID)
COMMENT_BODY=$(echo "$COMMENT_DATA" | jq -r .body)
COMMENT_AUTHOR=$(echo "$COMMENT_DATA" | jq -r .user.login)
```

#### Phase 2: Reply Composition
```bash
# Build reply with context
REPLY_BODY="$REPLY_MESSAGE"

# Add commit reference if requested
if [[ "$WITH_COMMIT" == "true" ]]; then
    LATEST_COMMIT=$(git log --oneline -1)
    COMMIT_SHA=$(echo "$LATEST_COMMIT" | cut -d' ' -f1)
    REPO_URL=$(git remote get-url origin | sed 's/\.git$//')
    
    REPLY_BODY+="

**Related commit**: [\`$COMMIT_SHA\`]($REPO_URL/commit/$COMMIT_SHA)"
fi

# Add professional footer
REPLY_BODY+="

---
*Replied via Claude Code*"
```

#### Phase 3: Post Reply
```bash
# Post comment reply
gh api repos/$OWNER/$REPO/issues/comments \
  --method POST \
  --field body="$REPLY_BODY"
```

---

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: URL Parsing and Validation
```bash
COMMENT_URL="$1"
REPLY_MESSAGE="$2"

# Validate inputs
if [[ -z "$COMMENT_URL" ]]; then
    echo "‚ùå Comment URL is required"
    echo "Usage: /reply-comment <comment-url> \"<message>\""
    exit 1
fi

if [[ -z "$REPLY_MESSAGE" ]] && [[ -z "$TEMPLATE" ]]; then
    echo "‚ùå Reply message or template is required"
    echo "Usage: /reply-comment <comment-url> \"<message>\""
    exit 1
fi

echo "üîç Parsing comment URL..."

# Extract GitHub comment details
if [[ "$COMMENT_URL" =~ https://github\.com/([^/]+)/([^/]+)/pull/([0-9]+)#issuecomment-([0-9]+) ]]; then
    OWNER="${BASH_REMATCH[1]}"
    REPO="${BASH_REMATCH[2]}"
    PR_NUMBER="${BASH_REMATCH[3]}"
    COMMENT_ID="${BASH_REMATCH[4]}"
    
    echo "‚úÖ Parsed GitHub comment:"
    echo "  Owner: $OWNER"
    echo "  Repo: $REPO"
    echo "  PR: #$PR_NUMBER"
    echo "  Comment ID: $COMMENT_ID"
else
    echo "‚ùå Invalid GitHub comment URL format"
    echo "Expected: https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123#issuecomment-456789"
    exit 1
fi
```

### Step 2: Fetch Comment Context
```bash
echo "üì• Fetching comment details..."

# Get comment data
if ! COMMENT_DATA=$(gh api repos/$OWNER/$REPO/issues/comments/$COMMENT_ID 2>/dev/null); then
    echo "‚ùå Failed to fetch comment #$COMMENT_ID"
    echo "Check permissions and comment exists"
    exit 1
fi

# Extract comment details
COMMENT_BODY=$(echo "$COMMENT_DATA" | jq -r .body)
COMMENT_AUTHOR=$(echo "$COMMENT_DATA" | jq -r .user.login)
COMMENT_DATE=$(echo "$COMMENT_DATA" | jq -r .created_at)
COMMENT_URL_API=$(echo "$COMMENT_DATA" | jq -r .html_url)

echo "‚úÖ Found comment by @$COMMENT_AUTHOR"
echo "üìÖ Created: $COMMENT_DATE"

# Get PR context
PR_DATA=$(gh pr view $PR_NUMBER --repo $OWNER/$REPO --json title,headRefName,baseRefName)
PR_TITLE=$(echo "$PR_DATA" | jq -r .title)
PR_BRANCH=$(echo "$PR_DATA" | jq -r .headRefName)

echo "üìã PR: $PR_TITLE"
echo "üåø Branch: $PR_BRANCH"

# Show comment preview (first 100 chars)
COMMENT_PREVIEW=$(echo "$COMMENT_BODY" | head -c 100 | tr '\n' ' ')
echo "üí¨ Comment preview: $COMMENT_PREVIEW..."
```

### Step 3: Generate Reply Content
```bash
echo "‚úçÔ∏è Composing reply..."

# Handle template-based replies
if [[ -n "$TEMPLATE" ]]; then
    case "$TEMPLATE" in
        "acknowledge")
            REPLY_MESSAGE="Thank you for the review! I'll address this suggestion."
            ;;
        "implemented")
            REPLY_MESSAGE="‚úÖ Implemented as suggested. Please review the changes."
            ;;
        "clarification")
            REPLY_MESSAGE="Could you provide more details on the preferred approach for this change?"
            ;;
        "alternative")
            REPLY_MESSAGE="I've implemented a slightly different approach that achieves the same goal. Please let me know if this works for you."
            ;;
        "declined")
            REPLY_MESSAGE="Thank you for the suggestion. After consideration, I believe the current approach is better suited for our use case."
            ;;
        *)
            echo "‚ùå Unknown template: $TEMPLATE"
            echo "Available templates: acknowledge, implemented, clarification, alternative, declined"
            exit 1
            ;;
    esac
    
    echo "üìù Using template: $TEMPLATE"
fi

# Build base reply
REPLY_BODY="$REPLY_MESSAGE"

# Add mention for original comment author if it's a bot
if [[ "$COMMENT_AUTHOR" == "coderabbitai" ]] || [[ "$COMMENT_AUTHOR" =~ bot$ ]]; then
    REPLY_BODY="@$COMMENT_AUTHOR $REPLY_BODY"
fi
```

### Step 4: Add Context and References
```bash
# Add commit reference if requested
if [[ "$WITH_COMMIT" == "true" ]]; then
    echo "üîó Adding commit reference..."
    
    if git log --oneline -1 >/dev/null 2>&1; then
        LATEST_COMMIT=$(git log --oneline -1)
        COMMIT_SHA=$(echo "$LATEST_COMMIT" | cut -d' ' -f1)
        COMMIT_MSG=$(echo "$LATEST_COMMIT" | cut -d' ' -f2-)
        
        # Get repository URL
        REPO_URL=$(git remote get-url origin | sed 's/\.git$//' | sed 's/git@github.com:/https:\/\/github.com\//')
        
        REPLY_BODY+="

**Related commit**: [\`$COMMIT_SHA\`]($REPO_URL/commit/$COMMIT_SHA) - $COMMIT_MSG"
        
        echo "‚úÖ Added commit reference: $COMMIT_SHA"
    else
        echo "‚ö†Ô∏è No git commits found, skipping commit reference"
    fi
fi

# Add branch information if relevant
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null)
if [[ -n "$CURRENT_BRANCH" ]] && [[ "$CURRENT_BRANCH" != "main" ]] && [[ "$CURRENT_BRANCH" != "master" ]]; then
    REPLY_BODY+="
**Branch**: \`$CURRENT_BRANCH\`"
fi

# Add timestamp
REPLY_BODY+="

```

### Step 5: Gemini Consultation (Optional)
```bash
if [[ "$WITH_GEMINI" == "true" ]]; then
    echo "ü§ñ Consulting with Gemini for response optimization..."
    
    # Prepare context for Gemini
    GEMINI_PROMPT="I'm replying to a code review comment. Please help optimize my response for professionalism and clarity.
